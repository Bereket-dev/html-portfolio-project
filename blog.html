            <h2>The Journey to Confidence as a Developer</h2>
            <p>This is my latest LinkedIn post, I reflect on a question that every developer has asked: "When will I
                become confident in my work?" Initially, I believed that confidence came from watching endless tutorials
                and reading documentation. But I've learned that confidence is built through action—by doing. It's not
                about passive learning, but about creating, failing, learning, and growing with every project. In this
                post, I share how experience, mistakes, and your portfolio shape your confidence as a developer. Read on
                to discover why you should stop waiting for the “perfect time” and start building today.</p>

            <h2>Certificate of Completion</h2>
            <p>I’ve just completed the Fundamentals of Programming course on Udacity on October 27, 2024! This milestone
                marks a significant step in my journey as a developer. The course covered key programming concepts that
                have strengthened my foundation, from logic and syntax to problem-solving techniques. In this blog, I
                share my key takeaways and how the skills learned will shape my next steps in software development.</p>
